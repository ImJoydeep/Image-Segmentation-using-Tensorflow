# Image-Segmentation-using-Tensorflow
Image segmentation with deep learning is about using a model to assign a class to each pixel in an image, thus segmenting the image into different zones (such as “background” and “foreground,” or “road,” “car,” and “sidewalk”). This general category of techniques can be used to power a considerable variety of valuable applications in image and video editing, autonomous driving, robotics, medical imaging, and so on.
